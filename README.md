## Graph json generation
The graph is automatically updated from the folder on the server. All you have to do is create a metric file in .json and that will be pushed to the graph.

## Table in markdown
On the machine learning notes,
to be able to track configuration changes use the markdown template then save file on the server and the table is automatically updated.
